## Who?

We're a group of students at University, currently charged with producing a video game version of a board game and we've chosen Othello.

## What?

Othello, for those who don't know, is a popular strategy-based board game, where the aim of the game is to have the most pieces on the board, once the board is full.

Othello starts off with four pieces - two white, two black, adjacent to each other. After this, the white piece tends to take the first go.

The only valid moves are moves where a counter of the opponent can be flipped. If this is not possible, then this player forfeit their moves until they are no longer in a stalemate against their opponent.

## Why?

We chose to make a video game implementation of Othello for several reasons.
