Welcome to our development website for CS2010's Group 4.

We're a group of students at University, currently charged with producing a video game version of a board game and we've chosen Othello.

Othello, for those who don't know, is a popular strategy-based board game, where the aim of the game is to have the most pieces on the board, once the board is full.

Othello starts off with four pieces - two white, two black.
