This is a development blog for our group project for the module CS2010. In our group project, we are re-creating the board game, Othello, as a video game.

Our intended purpose for this project is to create a 21st century version of Othello in order to revitalise a classic board game for a new generation.

The team consists of
- John Berg
- Arvinder Chatha
- Zakeria Hirsi
- Aleksander Kozina
- Eastwood Nketiah
- Sailesh Patel
- James Shorthouse
- Bruno Simao Zorima
- Charles Sims
